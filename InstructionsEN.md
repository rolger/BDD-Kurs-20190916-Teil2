# Supermarkt Kata

You and your team implemented an application to support different use-cases in a supermarket. The application
handles different products, you can scan articles and it prints a receipt during the checkout procedure.

Your task is to enhance the existing functionality. Our Product Owner has an idea, the application should handle 
special offerings.

*“We want to increase our customer binding, more customers should buy our products. Therefore want to add some special offerings 
to our supermarket shop “BEST SHOPPING”. The offering have to be presented clearly to the costumer. The customers should understand
which offerings have been applied and how they are calculated.”*

The team decided to drive this new features with acceptance tests implemented first. The existing project contains just Unit Tests. 
Somebody created already an acceptance test project, to setup the infrastructure.

### Hints

* Your job is to implement the acceptance tests first.
* Think of very small **small steps** - avoid breaking existing code.
* Your collegues implemented some Unit Test for the existing application. They used the framework Approval. 

---
## Exercise 1 - Get in touch with the existing project
* Browse through the code and look at the model and its services
* Understand how the project structure looks like
* Run the existing Unit Tests and look at the code

---
## Exercise 2 - Find stories and describe the acceptance criteria
* Which stories can you derive from the epic?
* Which specifications would describe the acceptance criteria sufficiently

---
## Exercise 3 - Implement the acceptance tests with Cucumber
* Write the feature files
* Implement the glue code 

---
## Exercise 4 - Implement the new features
* am besten mit TDD
* arbeite vor allem **in kleinen Schritten** d.h. nicht alle Akzeptanztest auf einmal
