# BDD Training Part-2 
This kata is inspired by https://github.com/emilybache/SupermarketReceipt-Refactoring-Kata and https://github.com/paulroho/SupermarketKata. 


## The legacy code
Your application is a supermarket. We can the checkout process via our service class. There are some integration tests 
to document the process at the supermarket checkout counter.  

### Acceptance Tests
The acceptance tests are located in a separate sub-project. The implementation of the tests is missing.
